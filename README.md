OpenCTD
=======

Source code for the OpenCTD

Reads an MS5803-14BA pressure sensor, 3-gang dallas temperature probe, and homebrewed conductivity circuit. 
Hacked together from code by Walt Holm, arduino.cc samples, and original code by Andrew Thaler. Runs on Arduino.

This code is currently a mess.
