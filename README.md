OpenCTD
=======

Source code for the OpenCTD

Reads an MS5803-14BA pressure sensor, 3-gang dallas temperature probe, and an Atlas conductivity circuit with homebrewed probe. 
Kludged together from code by Walt Holm, arduino.cc samples, Atlas scientific, and original code by Andrew Thaler. Runs on Arduino.

Currently a mess.
