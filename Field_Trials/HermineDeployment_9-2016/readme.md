Storms a brewin'
===================================

We deployed two OpenCTDs in a tidal estuary ahead of Hurricane Hermine. 

###Background

Hurricane Hermine is a tropical cyclone that passed over our field site in coastal Virginia on September 4, 2016. To test the longevity of the batteries and the durability of the OpenCTD during long term deployments, I placed two units in our Test Ditch (a tidally influence drainage ditch connected to the Mobjack Bay estuary that is conveniently located on our property), where they remained for 74 hours. 

###Notes

Data processing is still in progress, only raw data is available. Use at your own risk. 

One salinity probe appears to have lost calibration, furthur investigation will determine if the data is recoverable. 

###Lessons Learned

* 2,000 mAh batteries last for approximately 44 hours of continuous use on a full charge.
