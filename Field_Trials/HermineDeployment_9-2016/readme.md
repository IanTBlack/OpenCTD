Storms a brewin'
===================================

We deployed two OpenCTDs in a tidal estuary ahead of Hurricane Hermine. 

###Background

Hurricane Hermine is a tropical cyclone that passed over our field site in coastal Virginia on September 4, 2016. To test the longevity of the batteries and the durability of the OpenCTD during long term deployments, I placed two units in our Test Ditch (a tidally influence drainage ditch connected to the Mobjack Bay estuary that is conveniently located on our property), where they remained for 74 hours.

###Notes

One salinity probe appears to have lost calibration ([mid-level graphite probe](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/Field_Trials/HermineDeployment_9-2016/RAW%20Data/Hermine_1_graphiteprobe.txt)), furthur investigation will determine if the data is recoverable. This particular unit has been used for several dozen test deployments and has been pretty beaten up. It is likely that conductivity calibrations will need to be conducted more often than originally anticipated. 

###Lessons Learned

* 2,000 mAh batteries last for approximately 44 hours of continuous use on a full charge.
* Conductivity needs to be calibrated more frequently.
